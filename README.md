## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

H0 : The slope is zero
Ha : The slope is not zero

The results of the linear regression are summarized below.

1. Based on the data, and assuming a significance level of 0.05, vehicle length, ground clearance, and the intercept contributed non-random amounts of variance to the mpg values in this dataset. The p-values of these variables are below the significance level which means we can reject the hypothesis that their coefficients are zero.

2. The p-value of the overall model is 5.35 x 10^-11. Therefore, there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which means that the slope of the linear model is not zero.

3. An R-squared of 0.71 indicates that this linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively
